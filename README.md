# Perfect Pose Pro
Welcome to Perfect Pose Pro, an app to help with all of your posing needs!

To use the app, simply click on the gallery button in the bottom bar to input a photo representing the pose you wish to replicate. Then the app will run a pose detection algorithm on the image and draw a skeleton of the pose on the camera preview. When a user is in the frame, they will have their own skeleton. The joint angles of both the image and the user are calculated by the app and when they are within a certain threshold, a photo will be taken!
